Ember Wormhole [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yapplabs/ember-wormhole.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yapplabs/ember-wormhole) [![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-wormhole.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-wormhole)\n\nThis addon provides a component that allows for rendering a block\nto a DOM element somewhere else on the page. The component retains typical Ember\ncontext in terms of bound data and action handling. Ember Wormhole is\ncompatible with [Ember FastBoot](http://www.ember-fastboot.com/) as of version\n0.4.0, so long as the destination element is part of Ember's own templates.\n\n## Live Demo\n\nView a live demo here: [http://yapplabs.github.io/ember-wormhole/](http://yapplabs.github.io/ember-wormhole/)\n\n## But Why?\n\nThis library is particularly useful for cases where you have UI that is the logical child of\na component but needs to render as a top-level DOM element, such as a confirmation dialog.\n\n## And How?\n\nThis component tracks its element's child nodes. When inserted into the DOM, it appends\nits child nodes to a destination element elsewhere. When removed from the DOM, it\nremoves its child nodes, so as not to orphan them on the other side of the wormhole.\n\nNothing else changes -- data binding  and action bubbling still flow according to\nthe Ember component hierarchy. That includes usages of `yield`, so blocks provided\nto `ember-wormhole` simply appear in another part of the DOM.\n\n## Show Me Some Code!\n\nWe thought you'd never ask...\n\nGiven the following DOM:\n\n```html\n<body class=\"ember-application\">\n  <!-- Destination must be in the same element as your ember app -->\n  <!-- otherwise events/bindings will not work -->\n  <div id=\"destination\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"ember-view\">\n    <!-- rest of your Ember app's DOM... -->\n  </div>\n</body>\n```\n\nand a template like this:\n\n```hbs\n{{#ember-wormhole to=\"destination\"}}\n  Hello world!\n{{/ember-wormhole}}\n```\n\nThen \"Hello world!\" would be rendered inside the `destination` div.\n\nIf the ember-wormhole is destroyed its far-off children are destroyed too.\nFor example, given:\n\n```hbs\n{{#if isWormholeEnabled}}\n  {{#ember-wormhole to=\"destination\"}}\n    Hello world!\n  {{/ember-wormhole}}\n{{/if}}\n```\n\nIf `isWormholeEnabled` starts off true and becomes false, then the \"Hello\nworld!\" text will be removed from the `destination` div.\n\nSimilarly, if you use `ember-wormhole` in a route's template, it will\nrender its children in the destination element when the route is entered\nand remove them when the route is exited.\n\n## Can I Render In Place (i.e. Unwormhole)?\n\nYes! Sometimes you feel like a wormhole. Sometimes you don't. Situations\nsometimes call for the same content to be rendered through the wormhole or in place.\n\nIn this example, `renderInPlace` will override `to` and cause the wormhole content to be rendered in place.\n\n```hbs\n{{#ember-wormhole to=\"destination\" renderInPlace=\"true\"}}\n  Hello world!\n{{/ember-wormhole}}\n```\n\nThis technique is useful for:\n\n- Presenting typically-wormholed content within a styleguide\n- Toggling content back and forth through the wormhole\n- Parlor tricks\n\n## What if if my element has no id?\n\nYou can provide an element directly to the wormhole. For example:\n\n```hbs\n{{#ember-wormhole destinationElement=someElement}}\n  Hello world!\n{{/ember-wormhole}}\n```\n\nThis usage may be appropriate when using wormhole with dynamic targets,\nsuch as rendering into all elements matching a selector.\n\n## Development Setup\n\n### Installation\n\n* `git clone` this repository\n* `npm install`\n* `bower install`\n\n### Running Tests\n\n* `ember try:testall`\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`\n\n### Running the dummy app\n\n* `ember server`\n* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit [http://www.ember-cli.com/](http://www.ember-cli.com/).\n\n## Credits\n\nThis addon was extracted from [ember-modal-dialog](http://github.com/yapplabs/ember-modal-dialog).\nContributions from @stefanpenner, @krisselden, @chrislopresto, @lukemelia, @raycohen and\nothers.
