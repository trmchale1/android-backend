ember-cli-node-assets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dfreeman/ember-cli-node-assets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dfreeman/ember-cli-node-assets)\n\nIncorporate stylesheets, images, globals-style scripts and other assets directly from node modules into your Ember app or addon.\n\n## Usage\n\nIn an application's `ember-cli-build.js`:\n\n```js\nvar app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n  nodeAssets: {\n    // node asset options\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn an addon's `index.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  name: 'my-addon',\n  options: {\n    nodeAssets: {\n      // node asset options\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Module Configuration\n\nEach key in the `nodeAssets` hash corresponds to the name of a node module you want to include assets from. For example, the dummy app in this repo uses [slick-carousel](https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/) as a proof of concept and has the following configuration:\n\n```js\nnodeAssets: {\n  'slick-carousel': {\n    srcDir: 'slick',\n    import: ['slick.js', 'slick.css', 'slick-theme.css'],\n    public: ['ajax-loader.gif', 'fonts/*']\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEach key should contain a hash of the configuration for the corresponding module, with the options specified below. All configured paths are relative to that module's directory within the consuming app or addon's `node_modules` directory.\n\nIf your required assets depend on runtime configuration (e.g. if you have an addon with configurable theme support), you may specify a function that returns a configuration hash.\n\n```js\nnodeAssets: {\n  'some-node-module': function() {\n    return {\n      import: ['js/widget.js'],\n      public: ['css/widget-theme-' + this.config.theme + '.css']\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Imported Assets\n\nAssets that should be imported into your app or addon's `vendor.js` or `vendor.css` can be configured via a hash under the `import` key. Options:\n\n- `include`: an array of files that should be imported and concatenated into the served JS or CSS files. Each file may be:\n   - a string representing the path to file that should be imported\n   - a hash containing the following keys:\n     - `path`: the location of the file (required)\n     - `sourceMap`: the location of an existing sourceMap for that file (optional)\n     - any other options to be specified to [`app.import`](http://ember-cli.com/user-guide/), like `type: 'test'` or `prepend: true` (optional)\n- `srcDir` (optional): the source directory (relative to the module's directory) from which files should be included\n- `processTree` (optional): a function to perform any necessary processing on the Broccoli tree containing the given files before they are imported\n\nNote that you may pass an array of strings as the value for `import` instead of a hash as a shorthand for only specifying an `include` property, as in the usage example above.\n\n### Public Assets\n\nAssets that do not get built into the application itself but rather must be publicly available (e.g. images or webfonts) can be configured via a hash under the `public` key. Options:\n\n- `include`: an array of strings representing the files to be included in the `public` directory. Note that unlike with imported files, these strings may be path globs\n- `srcDir` (optional): the source directory (relative to the module's directory) from which files should be included\n- `destDir` (optional): the location in `dist` where your public assets will be placed. Defaults to `assets`.\n- `processTree` (optional): a function to perform any necessary processing on the Broccoli tree containing the given files before they are moved into `dist`\n\nNote that you may pass an array of strings as the value for `public` instead of a hash as a shorthand for only specifying an `include` property, as in the usage example above.\n\n### Shared Source directory\n\nIf your public and imported assets share a common source directory (e.g. `dist` or `build`), you may specify that as `srcDir` on the root configuration hash for the module, as in the usage example above.\n\n### Disabling Modules\n\nIf you have a module that you'd only like to include in certain situations, like an error reporting library you only want in production builds, you can include an `enabled` flag in the configuration for that model.\n\n```js\nnodeAssets: {\n  'bug-reporter': {\n    enabled: EmberApp.env() === 'production',\n    import: ['bug-reporter.js']\n  }\n}\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"dfreeman","email":"dfreeman@salsify.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-07-19T20:54:16.308Z","created":"2016-02-26T18:24:36.905Z","0.1.0":"2016-02-26T18:24:36.905Z","0.1.1":"2016-02-26T20:25:55.003Z","0.1.2":"2016-04-13T03:39:47.104Z","0.1.3":"2016-04-13T15:08:47.395Z","0.1.4":"2016-07-19T20:54:16.308Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/dfreeman/ember-cli-node-assets#readme","keywords":["ember-addon"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/dfreeman/ember-cli-node-assets.git"},"author":{"name":"Dan Freeman"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dfreeman/ember-cli-node-assets/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"samtsai":true,"codebruder":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"AIOHT1A0YX6YHUS6BRIMEZ80N\""}
