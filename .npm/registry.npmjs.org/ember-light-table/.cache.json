[Documentation](http://offirgolan.github.io/ember-light-table/docs)\n\n- ### [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Looking for help?\nIf it is a bug [please open an issue on GitHub](http://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/issues).\n\n## Usage\nThere are two parts to this addon. The first is the [Table](http://offirgolan.github.io/ember-light-table/docs/classes/Table.html) which you create with column definitions and rows, and the second is the component declaration.\n\n### Table Declaration\nThe `Table` constructor accepts an array of `Columns` or column options and an array of rows.\n\n```javascript\nimport Table from 'ember-light-table';\nconst table = new Table(columns, rows);\n```\n\nHere is a more real-word example\n\n```javascript\n// components/my-table.js\nimport Ember from 'ember';\nimport Table from 'ember-light-table';\n\nconst computed = Ember.computed;\n\nexport default Ember.Component.extend({\n  model: null,\n  table: null,\n\n  columns: computed(function() {\n    return [{\n      label: 'Avatar',\n      valuePath: 'avatar',\n      width: '60px',\n      sortable: false,\n      cellComponent: 'user-avatar'\n    }, {\n      label: 'First Name',\n      valuePath: 'firstName',\n      width: '150px'\n    }, {\n      label: 'Last Name',\n      valuePath: 'lastName',\n      width: '150px'\n    }, {\n      label: 'Address',\n      valuePath: 'address'\n    }, {\n      label: 'State',\n      valuePath: 'state'\n    }, {\n      label: 'Country',\n      valuePath: 'country'\n    }];\n  }),\n\n  init() {\n    this._super(...arguments);\n    this.set('table', new Table(this.get('columns'), this.get('model')));\n  }\n});\n```\n\nFor a list of possible column options, please [checkout out the docs](http://offirgolan.github.io/ember-light-table/docs/classes/Column.html).\n\n### Component Declaration\n\nNow that we have our `table`, we can declare our component in our template.\n\n```hbs\n{{#light-table table as |t|}}\n  {{t.head}}\n\n  {{#t.body as |body|}}\n    {{#body.expanded-row as |row|}}\n      Hello <b>{{row.firstName}}</b>\n    {{/body.expanded-row}}\n\n    {{#if isLoading}}\n      {{#body.loader}}\n        Loading...\n      {{/body.loader}}\n    {{/if}}\n\n    {{#if table.isEmpty}}\n      {{#body.no-data}}\n        No users found.\n      {{/body.no-data}}\n    {{/if}}\n  {{/t.body}}\n\n  {{t.foot}}\n{{/light-table}}\n```\n\nPlease note that each of these contextual components have a wide array of options so it is advised to look through the documentation.  \n","maintainers":[{"name":"offirgolan","email":"offirgolan@gmail.com"},{"name":"taras","email":"tarasm@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-08-04T18:12:43.320Z","created":"2016-03-10T22:29:47.698Z","0.1.0":"2016-03-10T22:29:47.698Z","0.1.1":"2016-03-11T20:14:16.804Z","0.1.2":"2016-03-14T23:53:54.005Z","0.1.3":"2016-03-21T21:47:05.172Z","0.1.4":"2016-03-22T22:06:07.562Z","0.1.5":"2016-03-25T23:46:55.180Z","0.1.6":"2016-03-29T20:43:38.278Z","0.1.7":"2016-04-07T18:57:00.161Z","0.1.8":"2016-04-27T22:42:17.063Z","0.1.9":"2016-04-28T19:21:54.941Z","1.0.0-beta.0":"2016-05-07T01:27:49.389Z","1.0.0-beta.1":"2016-05-09T21:36:31.203Z","1.0.0-beta.2":"2016-05-20T23:07:44.774Z","1.0.0-beta.3":"2016-05-25T19:11:14.422Z","1.0.0-beta.4":"2016-05-31T20:32:16.456Z","1.0.0-beta.5":"2016-06-09T23:10:52.283Z","1.0.0-beta.6":"2016-06-14T19:26:02.505Z","1.0.0-beta.7":"2016-06-24T20:30:38.483Z","1.0.0-beta.8":"2016-06-28T21:56:58.848Z","1.0.0":"2016-07-06T18:57:38.132Z","1.0.1":"2016-07-14T13:05:57.149Z","1.1.0":"2016-07-29T22:47:28.811Z","1.1.1":"2016-08-04T18:12:43.320Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table","keywords":["ember-addon","table"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"46BIILYU8BE6YX5HOVK7BEHYN\""}
