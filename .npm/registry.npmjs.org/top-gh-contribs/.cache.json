simple tool for grabbing the top contributors for a repo from github, with some convenient options.\n\nUsage\n----------------------\n\n```\nnpm install top-gh-contribs\n```\n\nReturns a promise for an array of contributors with the following attributes\n\n* `name` *The contributor's github username*\n* `githubUrl` *The contributors github profile url*\n* `avatarUrl` *The contributor's github avatar image url*\n* `commitCount` *The number of commits the contributor has since the specified release*\n\n```js\nvar topGithubContributors = require('top-gh-contribs');\n\nvar options = {\n    user: 'tryghost',\n    repo: 'ghost',\n    sinceDate: '2015-02-01', // All commits since 1st February 2015\n    count: 20\n};\n\ntopGithubContributors(options).then(function (contributors) {\n    /* Do stuff with contributors*/\n});\n```\n\n### Options\n\n* `user` **required**\n* `repo` **required**\n    If you're looking for contributors to `tryghost/ghost`, then your `user` is `\"tryghost\"` and `repo` is `\"ghost\"`.\n* `oauthKey` ::\n    If a GitHub oauth key is provided it will be used when making requests against the API.\n* `sinceDate` ::\n    A date, in ISO8601 format e.g 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' or 'YYYY-MM-DD' format e.g. '2015-02-01' = 1st February 2015\n    If `sinceDate` is not provided, all commits will be counted.\n    Note: you can install moment.js and then use:\n    var moment = require('moment');\n    sinceDate: moment().subtract(90, 'days').format('YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ') to get a formatted date including time\n    for past 90 days\n* `count`\n    The number of contributors to return. If not specified, all contributors will be returned.\n* `retry`\n    Default `false`.
