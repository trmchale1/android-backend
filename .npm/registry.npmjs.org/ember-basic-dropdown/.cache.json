Ember-basic-dropdown\n\nThis is a very minimal dropdown. That means that it is agnostic about what it is going to contain.\n\nIt is intended to be a building block for more complex components but is perfectly usable.\n\n### Compatibility\n\n**Warning**. This component suffered a full re-write of its public API in 0.12.\nUntil 0.11.X, the compatiblity was 1.13+\nStarting in 0.12, the compatibility is 2.3.1+.\n\n### Installation\n\n```\nember install ember-basic-dropdown\n```\n\nIf you are using this addon in an application that uses ember-cli-sass, you need to import the\nstyles explicitly.\n\nAdd to your `app.scss` this line:\n\n```scss\n@import 'ember-basic-dropdown';\n```\n\nIf you are using [ember-power-select](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-power-select) you don't need\nany of those steps because you already have this addon :D\n\n### Usage\n\nThis component leverages contextual components for its API:\n\n```hbs\n{{#basic-dropdown as |dropdown|}}\n  {{#dropdown.trigger}}Click me{{/dropdown.trigger}}\n  {{#dropdown.content}}Content of the trigger{{/dropdown.content}}\n{{/basic-dropdown}}\n```\n\n### Features\n\n#### Renders on the body or in place\n\nBy default this component will render the dropdown in the body using ember-wormhole and absolutely\nposition it to place it in the proper coordinates.\n\nYou can opt out to this behavior by passing `renderInPlace=true`. That will add the dropdown just\nbelow the trigger.\n\n#### Intelligent dropdown position\n\nThis component is smart about where to position the dropdown. It will detect the best place to render\nit based on the space around the trigger, and also will take care of reposition if if the screen is\nresized, scrolled, the device changes it orientation or the content of the dropdown changes\n(implemented with MutationObservers in modern browsers with fallback to DOM events in IE 9/10).\n\nYou can force the component to be fixed in one position by passing `verticalPosition = above | below` and/or `horizontalPosition = right | center | left`.\n\n#### Closed automatically when click outside the component\n\nYou don't need to care about adding or removing events, it does that for you.\n\n#### Keyboard support\n\nThe trigger of the component is focusable by default, and when focused can be triggered using
