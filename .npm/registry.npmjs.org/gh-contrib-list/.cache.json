commits\n\n## Usage:\n\n```\nnpm install gh-contrib-list\n```\n\nIn code:\n\n```javascript\nvar ghContribList = require('gh-contrib-list');\n\nghContribList(options);\n```\n\nReturns a Promise with an array of contributors. Each contributor has the following properties:\n\n- `id` - Github username of the contributor\n- `name` - Full name of the contributor\n- `commitCount` - Number of commits the person has contributed\n\n### Options\n\n- `user` - The user or organization (**required**)\n- `repo` - The repository name (**required**)\n- `commit` - A commit SHA to run the query from (commits including and after this one will be used) (**required**)\n- `oauthKey` - If one is provided it will be used when making Github API requests\n- `to` - If another commit SHA is provided here the commits used will be between the `commit` option and this one.\n- `removeGreenkeeper` - If this is set to true, any commits by Greenkeeper will be automatically removed.\n- `retry` - If this is set to true, the request will be retried in the event that the Github API returns a 202 status (retry momentarily).\n\n---\n\n## Credit:\n\nThis script is heavily based on [top-gh-contribs](https://github.com/novaugust/top-gh-contribs).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"acburdine","email":"austin@acburdine.me"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-07-23T17:00:54.677Z","created":"2016-06-29T05:06:26.824Z","0.1.0":"2016-06-29T05:06:26.824Z","0.1.1":"2016-06-29T15:15:05.809Z","0.1.2":"2016-07-23T17:00:54.677Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/acburdine/gh-contrib-list#readme","keywords":["github","contributors"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/acburdine/gh-contrib-list.git"},"author":{"name":"Austin Burdine","email":"acburdine@gmail.com","url":"http://github.com/acburdine"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/acburdine/gh-contrib-list/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"B7FNHMJY9QANP6CVYKS0E8X3J\""}
