[lodash](https://lodash.com/) library (its [ES6 module variant](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/es)) in [ember-cli](http://ember-cli.com) apps.\n\n## Use\n\nFirst you install this addon\n\n```sh\n# ember-cli > 0.2.3\nember install ember-lodash\n# ember-cli <= 0.2.3\nember install:addon ember-lodash\n```\n\nAnd then in your ember.js app, you can import individual lodash modules freely\n\n```js\nimport _string from 'lodash/string';\n\nlet truncatedString = _string.trunc(rawString);\n```\n\nAdditionally, if you wish to work with the entire lodash library on a single namespace, you have the option of importing that as well\n\n```js\nimport _ from 'lodash/lodash';\n\nlet truncatedString = _.trunc(rawString);\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n* `git clone` this repository\n* `npm install`\n* `bower install`\n\n## Running\n\n* `ember server`\n* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.\n\n## Running Tests\n\n* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:testall` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`\n\n## Building\n\n* `ember build`\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit [http://www.ember-cli.com/](http://www.ember-cli.com/).\n\n![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-66610985-1/mike-north/ember-lodash/readme)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"northm","email":"michael.l.north@gmail.com"},{"name":"tchak","email":"paul+npm@chavard.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-07-03T02:11:17.740Z","created":"2015-07-05T21:15:05.819Z","0.0.1":"2015-07-05T21:15:05.819Z","0.0.2":"2015-07-05T21:42:02.402Z","0.0.3":"2015-07-05T22:27:47.629Z","0.0.4":"2015-07-11T23:12:17.815Z","0.0.5":"2015-07-31T05:43:29.257Z","0.0.6":"2015-11-16T12:54:16.981Z","0.0.7":"2016-04-25T18:01:20.543Z","0.0.9":"2016-06-11T10:36:17.020Z","0.0.10":"2016-07-03T02:11:17.740Z"},"keywords":["ember-addon"],"author":{"name":"Mike
