[Sinon](https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS) to assist in testing your Ember CLI app.\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you are using Ember CLI 0.2.3 or higher:\n\n```\nember install ember-sinon\n```\n\notherwise:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev ember-sinon\nember g ember-sinon\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nWhile in testing mode (i.e. either when visiting `/tests` or when running `ember test`), `sinon` will be available as an import.\n\n```js\nimport sinon from 'sinon';\n\ntest(\".runCallback() should run the callback passed\", function(assert) {\n  var spy = sinon.spy();\n  this.subject().runCallback(spy);\n\n  // Default Sinon messages:\n  sinon.assert.calledOnce(spy);\n  sinon.assert.calledWith(spy, 'foo');\n\n  // Custom messages:\n  assert.ok(spy.calledOnce, \"the callback should be called once\");\n  assert.ok(spy.calledWith('foo'), \"the callback should be passed 'foo' as an argument\");\n});\n```\n\n## Integration with testing frameworks\n\nCheck out [ember-sinon-qunit](https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-sinon-qunit) for QUnit integration!\n\n## Running Tests\n\nYou must have PhantomJS installed to run tests.\n\n```\nnpm
