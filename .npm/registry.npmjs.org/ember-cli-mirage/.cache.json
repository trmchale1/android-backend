Ember CLI app.\n\n<http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/>\n\n----\n\nAre you tired of\n\n- Writing one set of fixtures for your tests, and another for development?\n- Wiring up tests for each of your apps manually, from scratch?\n- Changing lots of files/tests when your API changes?\n\nEmber CLI Mirage may be for you! It lets you create a client-side server using [Pretender](https://github.com/trek/pretender) to help you develop and test your app. By default, it only runs if you're not in production and if you're not proxying to an explicit API server via `ember serve --proxy`.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nember install ember-cli-mirage  # install:addon for Ember CLI < 0.2.3\n```\n\n## Updating\n\nThis project is new and the API is subject to change. When updating your project to a newer version of Ember CLI Mirage, please consult [the changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) for any update notes.\n\n## Getting started\n\nCheck out the [Docs](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/docs/v0.1.x/)!\n\n## Support\n\nHaving trouble? Open an issue!\n","maintainers":[{"name":"samselikoff","email":"sam.selikoff@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-06-22T20:16:33.570Z","created":"2015-02-28T17:36:35.692Z","0.0.19":"2015-02-28T17:36:35.692Z","0.0.21":"2015-03-04T02:18:28.492Z","0.0.22":"2015-03-08T21:38:00.014Z","0.0.23":"2015-03-14T03:03:52.487Z","0.0.24":"2015-04-02T13:04:35.725Z","0.0.25":"2015-04-17T18:44:59.128Z","0.0.26":"2015-04-17T19:40:17.668Z","0.0.27":"2015-04-25T02:34:15.296Z","0.0.28":"2015-05-16T22:31:01.212Z","0.0.29":"2015-05-20T20:17:14.424Z","0.1.0":"2015-06-01T12:35:39.666Z","0.1.1":"2015-06-01T14:40:42.793Z","0.1.2":"2015-06-01T22:26:02.998Z","0.1.3":"2015-06-10T15:55:05.852Z","0.1.4":"2015-06-10T16:12:19.819Z","0.1.5":"2015-06-22T19:56:51.176Z","0.1.6":"2015-07-27T11:51:02.216Z","0.1.7":"2015-08-17T15:07:26.781Z","0.1.8":"2015-08-18T02:12:49.656Z","0.1.9":"2015-10-05T12:03:33.129Z","0.1.10":"2015-10-13T18:25:14.596Z","0.1.11":"2015-10-14T12:06:44.384Z","0.2.0-beta.1":"2015-11-07T18:54:11.737Z","0.2.0-beta.2":"2016-01-15T23:09:36.219Z","0.2.0-beta.3":"2016-01-16T22:54:25.847Z","0.2.0-beta.4":"2016-02-09T04:57:20.215Z","0.2.0-beta.5":"2016-02-19T02:51:51.722Z","0.2.0-beta.6":"2016-02-24T21:10:38.856Z","0.2.0-beta.7":"2016-02-25T14:35:59.253Z","0.2.0-beta.8":"2016-03-24T16:09:07.951Z","0.1.12":"2016-03-29T18:28:40.806Z","0.1.13":"2016-03-30T07:24:19.520Z","0.2.0-beta.9":"2016-05-13T16:26:15.918Z","0.2.0":"2016-05-31T14:42:24.348Z","0.2.1":"2016-06-22T20:16:33.570Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage","keywords":["ember-addon","pretender","testing","prototype","server"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage.git"},"author":{"name":"Sam Selikoff"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"gregone":true,"mswanson1524":true,"neilor":true,"darrylr":true,"bmeurant":true,"eturino":true,"equimper":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"7RTIF8444NUII59KXCYV64WK1\""}
