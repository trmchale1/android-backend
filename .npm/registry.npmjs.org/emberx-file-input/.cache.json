I select files very, very well.\n\n`x-file-input` is a tiny re-usable component which does one thing and\nonly: binds an action to the native html file selection dialog while\nallowing you to render arbitrary HTML to act as the trigger for that\nfile selector.\n\nThis allows you to compose it with whatever other components and\napplication code you need to make that perfect workflow that involves\nselecting files: from uploads to imports.\n\nWhat you do with the files once they are selected? Welp, that's\nbetween you and your app.\n\n## Installation\n\n`ember install emberx-file-input`\n\n## Usage\n\nBind an action to the file input:\n\n```handlebars\n{{x-file-input name=\"files\" multiple=true action=(action \"didSelectFiles\") alt=\"Choose a File\"}}\n```\n\nWhenever the user selects a file, the `didSelectfiles` action will be\ninvoked with an array of [File][1] objects.\n\n> Note: Whether the file input is for a single file or mulitple files,\n> it will always return an array of `File` objects upon selection.\n\nIn its blockless form, it will render as a bare\n`input[type=file]`. Like this:\n\n<input type=file name=\"files\" alt=\"Choose a File\"/>\n\n\nBut that's kinda ugly! For beautiful file inputs, pass a block. This\nHTML will be used as the trigger of the file input.\n\n```hbs\n{{#x-file-input multiple=true action=(action \"didSelectFiles\")}}\n  <img src=\"http://i-should-buy-a-boat-cat.com\" alt=\"I should buy a boat\"/>\n{{/x-file-input}}\n```\n\nInstead of that boring old stock file selector, your users will see\nthis:\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; display: inline-block;\">\n  <img style=\"pointer-events: none; display: block; border-radius: 10px;\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Mj0xj.jpg\" alt=\"I should buy a boat\"/>\n  <input type=\"file\" name=\"files\" alt=\"Choose a File\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;\"/>\n</div>\n\nAnd don't worry, that custom trigger is a form label, so the file input remains\n100% accessible.\n\n## Customizing the CSS\n\nThe whole point of this component is for you to customize your inputs with CSS\nand make them look *much* better than the native inputs. Lets look at a simple\nexample.\n\nHere is our component. You can see we have a custom class applied to the block\ncalled `custom-class`. We are going to use that class to apply our styles.\n\n```hbs\n{{#x-file-input class=\"custom-class\" action=\"uploadAPhoto\"}}\n  <h3>Shall you upload?</h3>\n{{/x-file-input}}\n```\n\nIn our CSS we want to target `.custom-class label` because the label is the\nelement that we're making look nice.\n\n```css\n.custom-class label {\n  background: #34495e;\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: white;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n```\n\nThis css will make our button look a little something like this:\n![Custom file input styling](http://i.imgur.com/OHTMaAQ.png)\n\nWe are not done yet! Since we're replicating a native input with\nHTML and CSS we have to make sure we replicate all of the \"default\"\nfeatures we get when using a native file input. One of those things is a css\n`:hover` and `:focus` state. These are often overlooked but are critcal to add.\nIn your CSS you need to add the following:\n\n```css\n.x-file--input:focus + label,\n.x-file--input + label:hover {\n  /* Apply your own hover state */\n  background-color: #2C3E50;\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's it! Your file input is now styled and decked to the nines!\nIf you would like to see a real [life example checkout the demo page](http://thefrontside.github.io/emberx-file-input)\n\n\n## EmberX\n\nemberx-file-input is part of the \"missing components of ember\" collectively\nknown as emberx:\n\n* [emberx-select](https://github.com/thefrontside/emberx-select)\n* [emberx-slider](https://github.com/thefrontside/emberx-slider)\n* [emberx-file-input](https://github.com/thefrontside/emberx-file-input)\n\n\n[1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File\n","maintainers":[{"name":"cowboyd","email":"cowboyd@frontside.io"},{"name":"robdel12","email":"Robertdeluca19@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-10-09T18:29:37.517Z","created":"2015-10-09T18:25:56.611Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-09T18:25:56.611Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/thefrontside/emberx-file-input","keywords":["ember-addon","file input","file selector","custom file input"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/thefrontside/emberx-file-input"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/thefrontside/emberx-file-input/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"mswanson1524":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"2LT9XRF1XOZ6XUEV5KESEDDT0\""}
