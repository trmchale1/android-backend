ember-invoke-action\n[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-invoke-action.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ember-invoke-action)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/martndemus/ember-invoke-action.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/martndemus/ember-invoke-action)\n[![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-invoke-action.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-invoke-action)\n\nA slightly more idiomatic way to invoke actions in your Ember components.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nember install ember-invoke-action\n```\n\n## How To\n\nYou can either use `ember-invoke-action` as a helper function or a mixin.\n\n### Mixin usage\n\n```javascript\nimport Ember from 'ember';\nimport { InvokeActionMixin } from 'ember-invoke-action';\n\nexport default Ember.Component.extend(InvokeActionMixin, {\n  click(...args) {\n    this.invokeAction('click', ...args);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Helper usage\n\n```javascript\nimport Ember from 'ember';\nimport { invokeAction } from 'ember-invoke-action';\n\nexport default Ember.Component.extend({\n  click(...args) {\n    invokeAction(this, 'click', ...args);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### `strictInvokeAction`\n\nAs alternative to `invokeAction` you can call `strictInvokeAction`.\n`strictInvokeAction` is functionally the same as `invokeAction` except for when\nthe given action could not be found, then `strictInvokeAction` will raise an\n`AssertionError`.\n\n### `invoke`\n\nWith the `invoke` helper you can call other actions from the `actions` object as\nif it is a closure action.\n\n```javascript\nimport Ember from 'ember';\nimport { invoke } from 'ember-invoke-action';\n\nexport default Ember.Component.extend({\n  actions: {\n    saveModel() {\n      return get(this, 'model').save();\n    },\n\n    closeModal() {\n      set(this, 'modalVisible', false);\n    },\n\n    saveModelAndClose(...args) {\n      invoke(this, 'closeModal');\n      return invoke(this, 'saveModel');\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nThis code was inspired by @miguelcobain, I just made an addon out of it.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"martndemus","email":"mail@martenschilstra.nl"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-08-01T08:52:19.038Z","created":"2015-11-04T16:28:19.202Z","1.0.0":"2015-11-04T16:28:19.202Z","1.1.0":"2015-11-04T17:02:09.209Z","1.2.0":"2015-11-05T13:25:32.279Z","1.3.0":"2016-03-02T13:58:58.214Z","1.3.1":"2016-08-01T08:52:19.038Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/martndemus/ember-invoke-action#readme","keywords":["ember-addon"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/martndemus/ember-invoke-action.git"},"author":{"name":"Marten
