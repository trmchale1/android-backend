ember-route-action-helper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DockYard/ember-route-action-helper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DockYard/ember-route-action-helper) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-route-action-helper.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-route-action-helper)\n*Credit: @rwjblue's [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/jipani/edit?html,js,output)*\n\nDemo: http://jsbin.com/jipani/edit?html,js,output\n\n```no-highlight\nember install ember-route-action-helper\n```\n\nThe `route-action` helper allows you to bubble closure actions, which will delegate it to the currently active route hierarchy per the bubbling rules explained under `actions`. Like closure actions, `route-action` will also have a return value.\n\nHowever, returning `true` in an action will **not** preserve bubbling semantics. In case you would like that behavior, you should use ordinary string actions instead.\n\n## Usage\n\nFor example, this route template tells the component to lookup the `updateFoo` action on the route when its internal `clicked` property is invoked, and curries the function call with 2 arguments.\n\n```hbs\n{{! foo/route.hbs }}\n{{foo-bar clicked=(route-action \"updateFoo\" \"Hello\" \"world\")}}\n```\n\nIf the action is not found on the current route, it is bubbled up:\n\n```js\n// application/route.js\nimport Ember from 'ember';\n\nconst { Route, set } = Ember;\n\nexport default Route.extend({\n  actions: {\n    updateFoo(...args) {\n      // handle action\n      return 42;\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe `route-action` has a return value:\n\n```js\n// foo/component.js\nimport Ember from 'ember';\n\nconst { Component } = Ember;\n\nexport default Component.extend({\n  actions: {\n    anotherAction(...args) {\n      let result = this.get('updateFoo')(...args);\n\n      console.log(result); // 42\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou may also use in conjunction with the `{{action}}` helper:\n\n```js\n<button {{action (route-action 'updateFoo')}}>Update Foo</button>\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis addon will work on Ember versions `1.13.x` and up only, due to use of the new `Helper` implementation.\n\n## Installation\n\n* `git clone` this repository\n* `npm install`\n* `bower install`\n\n## Running\n\n* `ember server`\n* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.\n\n## Running Tests\n\n* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:testall` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`\n\n## Building\n\n* `ember build`\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit [http://www.ember-cli.com/](http://www.ember-cli.com/).\n\n## Legal\n\n[DockYard](http://dockyard.com/ember-consulting), Inc &copy; 2015\n\n[@dockyard](http://twitter.com/dockyard)\n\n[Licensed under the MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"dockyard","email":"oss@dockyard.com"},{"name":"rwjblue","email":"me@rwjblue.com"},{"name":"sugarpirate","email":"arr@sugarpirate.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-07-21T16:12:19.153Z","created":"2015-12-04T18:57:30.310Z","0.1.0":"2015-12-04T18:57:30.310Z","0.2.0":"2015-12-05T19:16:24.053Z","0.3.0":"2016-02-05T21:01:55.942Z","0.3.1":"2016-04-20T13:51:47.633Z","0.3.2":"2016-06-10T00:53:04.160Z","0.3.3":"2016-07-19T15:05:55.235Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/DockYard/ember-route-action-helper#readme","keywords":["ember-addon","helper","route action"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/DockYard/ember-route-action-helper.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/DockYard/ember-route-action-helper/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"codebruder":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"C1SCF5Y1GMXMWDCVAVNNB25WD\""}
